# Datacamp Projects Portfolio
Applying data science skills to solve real-world problems, from [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/).

The projects in this repo are designed by Datacamp, but include some of my own extended analysis/codes/approaches, instead of the official answers provided.

## Transportation Fuel Prices Prediction - Time Series Analysis
Skilss: Business problem solving, time series analysis, statistics testing, prediction, modelling.

The 22nd Century Sporting League is seeking advice from us, the Office of Transportation, on optimising its 2102 game schedule and reducing transportation costs. The main concerns are determining the required number of jets and estimating fuel expenses. They’ve shared the team travel schedules, estimated departure/arrival times, and past season’s daily fuel prices, and request from us future fuel price projections.

We will estimate the maximum number of jets needed and use time series analysis to predict the fuel price.

## Cluster Antarctic Penguins Species
Skills: Machine Learning, clustering, data manipulation, data visualisation.

We are requested from the biology researchers team who missed the records of the three penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, and try to use the machine learning skills with the data of the penguins, to help them identify the species.

## Sowing Success - Machine Learning Applied In Agriculture For Selecting the Best Crops
Skills: Machine Learning, logistic regression, data manipulation, feature engineering.

The farmers need to decide which crop to plant by knowing the most suitable crop based on soil condition, while also identifying which soil metric (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value) is most critical for accurate predictions. In this project, we build a multi-class classification model that predicts crop type from soil metrics and determine the single most important feature influencing predictive performance.
